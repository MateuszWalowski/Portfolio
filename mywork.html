                    The goal of the first theme was to teach us basic knowledge about user interface design and
                    responsive web design.
                    In this assigment we were supposed to design a responsive website with at least 2 breakpoints using
                    media queries and css grid structure.
                    My website has 2 breakpoints, at 600 pixels and 900 pixels of viewport width.

            <grid-item>

                <p>
                    I have used many grids throught my website, since they are an easy way to implement responsivness to
                    the website. I have also decided to use responsive size units, such as em, vh, vw and %.
                    Breakpoints on the website affect structure of the grids, white space and the navigation bar.

                    First assigment in this module was meant to help us familiarize with different methods of collecting
                    data. We learnt about the differences between primary research, which means various methods of gathering
                    relevant data ourselves (for example observation or interview) and secondary research, which
                    involves previously collected and published data (for example desk research).

In this assigment we had to build an XD prototype of a website, which helps new international students in Copenhagen to find a job. We had to research design conventions of a job portal and tone of voice used on such websites.

                    We also had a chance to test our website using various UX testing methods, such as survey, five second test and think aloud test. Results of those tests were meant to give us insight on how to improve our website. <br>

In this assigment we were designing an app for KEA students, following the Google design sprint method. We had 5 days to design it, and every day was a different phase of the sprint.

                    We have learnt various methods of sketching, such as four-step sketch and Crazy 8s. We also had to learn how to discuss the problem in larger group, for example using sprint questions and HMW (How Might We?) notes.

In this assigment we had to work in pairs on projects that we could choose from project pool. All of these projects required Javascript skills. 
First project we worked on was drum machine, where user could press buttons to play different instruments. Together with other student we accomplished that task, and we also added visual indicator - buttons indicating each instruments would change color every time user press the key.

In this assigment we had to create an onboarding website that uses gamification elements and explains an important aspect about moving to Denmark. My group decided that our onboarding app would help user to learn about the most important documents he might need after moving to the country.

            <grid-item>

                <p>
I have coded and designed the website myself, with other members helping me with illustrations and text. We achieved gamification of the site by having our user progress through the screens, and going through the quiz at the end. <br> Link to the website

In this project for the first time we had a chance to work with a client - Foodsharing Copenhagen. We had to create a campaign website that would adress one of two issues, either convincing people to become a volunteer or raise awarness of the food waste. 
My group decided to focus on the first problem.

            <grid-item>

                <p>
Our group worked together on the design and graphic elements of the website, but I have coded it myself. I have also helped to record the video. 
In preparation for this project, I have researched about the scale of the food waste problem, links to the sources I was using are included in the website.

As part of the campaign website we also had to shoot a video. Before we could do that, we had to prepare a storyboard and wait for it to be approved.

                    Our storyboard shows the foodsharing event from the point of view of a volunteer. Our final video follows the storyboard closely, and also adds a short interview with one of the volunteers.
